# Jethr0's Scripts
A bunch of useful little scripts to put into your .bash profile. CONSTANTLY UPDATED

# Installation
Place all of the .sh scripts into a directory (doesn't really matter which, but you should have a dedicated directory for any aliases and programs), then edit your .bashrc (sometimes called .bash_profile) and near the bottom of the page, type:
"alias (command you want to use)='path/to/the/script'
Then exit the text editor. Enter the command:
"source .bashrc" or "source .bash_profile"

And that's it! You should now be able to enter the command you chose as an alias and trigger the scripts (e.g "note" would trigger create_note.sh)
